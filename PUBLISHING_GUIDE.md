## 🚀 Publishing Steps

### Step 1: Get Your Gradle Plugin Portal Credentials

1. Go to https://plugins.gradle.org/
2. Sign in with your GitHub account (or create an account)
3. Navigate to your profile → API Keys
4. Generate a new API key pair (if you don't have one):
   - You'll get a **Key** and a **Secret**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Save these securely - the secret is only shown once!

### Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/bitmoxie/monorepo-changed-projects-plugin
2. Navigate to: **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add two secrets:

   **Secret 1:**
   - Name: `GRADLE_PUBLISH_KEY`
   - Value: [Your API Key from Plugin Portal]

   **Secret 2:**
   - Name: `GRADLE_PUBLISH_SECRET`
   - Value: [Your API Secret from Plugin Portal]

### Step 3: Test Publishing Locally (Optional but Recommended)

Before publishing to the portal, test the process locally:

```bash
# Set credentials as environment variables
export GRADLE_PUBLISH_KEY=your-key-here
export GRADLE_PUBLISH_SECRET=your-secret-here

# Validate plugin configuration
./gradlew validatePlugins

# Dry run (validates but doesn't publish)
./gradlew publishPlugins --validate-only
```

### Step 4: Choose Your Publishing Method

You have **two ways** to publish:

#### Option A: Automated Publishing with Release Please (Recommended)

1. Make commits using conventional commit format:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add awesome feature"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve bug"
   ```

2. Push to main:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Release Please will automatically:
   - Create a release PR with version bump
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - Update version in build.gradle.kts

4. Review and merge the release PR

5. Once merged, the plugin will **automatically publish** to Gradle Plugin Portal!

#### Option B: Manual Publishing with Tag

1. Create and push a version tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. The `release.yml` workflow will trigger and:
   - Build the plugin
   - Run all tests
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Publish to Gradle Plugin Portal

## 🎯 What Happens When You Publish

### Via Release Please (Automatic)
1. **Commit** → conventional commit to main
2. **PR Created** → Release Please creates/updates release PR
3. **Review** → You review the changes and version bump
4. **Merge** → PR is merged to main
5. **Release** → GitHub release is created
6. **Publish** → Plugin automatically published to Plugin Portal
7. **Available** → Users can immediately use your plugin!

### Via Tag (Manual)
1. **Tag** → Create and push version tag (e.g., v1.0.0)
2. **Build** → GitHub Actions builds and tests
3. **Release** → GitHub release created with artifacts
4. **Publish** → Plugin published to Plugin Portal
5. **Available** → Users can immediately use your plugin!

### Timeline
- **Publishing to Portal:** Usually 5-15 minutes
- **Portal Indexing:** Additional 10-30 minutes
- **Searchable:** Plugin appears in search within 1 hour

## 📦 After Publishing

### Verify Publication
1. Check https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.bitmoxie.monorepo-changed-projects
2. Verify version, description, and metadata
3. Check that the "Read More" link points to your GitHub repo

### Test Installation
Create a test project and verify users can install your plugin:

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
    }
}

// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    id("com.bitmoxie.monorepo-changed-projects") version "1.0.0"
}

projectsChanged {
    baseBranch = "main"
    includeUntracked = true
}
```

```bash
./gradlew detectChangedProjects
```

### Update Badges (Optional)
Add to README.md:

```markdown
[![Gradle Plugin Portal](https://img.shields.io/gradle-plugin-portal/v/com.bitmoxie.monorepo-changed-projects?logo=gradle)](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.bitmoxie.monorepo-changed-projects)
```

### Announce Your Plugin
- Tweet about it with #GradlePlugin
- Post on Reddit r/gradle
- Share in Kotlin Slack #gradle channel
- Write a blog post about it

---

## 🔄 Future Releases

For subsequent releases, the process is even easier:

### Using Release Please (Recommended)
1. Make conventional commits
2. Merge release PR when ready
3. Plugin automatically publishes

### Version Bumping Rules
- `feat:` → MINOR version bump (1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
- `fix:` → PATCH version bump (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` → MAJOR version bump (1.0.0 → 2.0.0)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Publishing Fails - Authentication Error
- **Cause:** Invalid or missing GRADLE_PUBLISH_KEY/SECRET
- **Fix:** Verify secrets are set correctly in GitHub, no extra spaces

### Publishing Fails - Plugin ID Already Exists
- **Cause:** Plugin ID is taken by another developer
- **Fix:** Change the plugin ID in build.gradle.kts and try again

### Publishing Succeeds but Plugin Not Found
- **Cause:** Portal indexing delay
- **Fix:** Wait 30-60 minutes, it will appear

### Version Already Published
- **Cause:** You can't republish the same version
- **Fix:** Bump the version and publish again

### Validation Fails
- **Cause:** Missing required metadata (website, vcsUrl, etc.)
- **Fix:** Run `./gradlew validatePlugins` to see specific issues
